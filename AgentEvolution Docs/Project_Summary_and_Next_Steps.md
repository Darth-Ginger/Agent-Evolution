# Project Summary and Next Steps

## **Current State of the Project**

### **1. API Functionality**
- **Tasks**:
  - CRUD operations are implemented.
  - Partial updates for tasks (e.g., `description` and `status`) are functional.
- **Agents**:
  - CRUD operations are implemented.
  - Agents can have a `base_prompt` property.
  - Flexible capability updates (`overwrite`, `append`, `remove`) are implemented and documented.
- **Relationships**:
  - Nodes (e.g., Agents and Tasks) can be linked with relationships (`ASSIGNED_TO`, `CAN_EXECUTE`).
  - Endpoints exist for creating and querying relationships.
  - Management
Create Relationship:

Requirements:
Endpoint: POST /neo4j/relationships
Accepts a JSON payload with the following fields:
start_node_label: Label of the starting node (e.g., Agent).
start_node_id: ID of the starting node.
end_node_label: Label of the ending node (e.g., Task).
end_node_id: ID of the ending node.
relationship_type: Type of relationship (e.g., ASSIGNED_TO).
Validates that both nodes exist before creating the relationship.
Returns a success message upon creation.
Test Cases:
Valid relationship creation.
Non-existent start_node or end_node.
Read Relationships:

Requirements:
Endpoint: GET /neo4j/relationships/{node_label}/{node_id}
Retrieves all outgoing relationships for the specified node.
Returns the relationship_type, end_node_labels, and end_node_id for each relationship.
Responds with a 404 error if the node does not exist.
Test Cases:
Retrieve relationships for a valid node.
Invalid id (node not found).
- **Neo4j Integration**:
  - Database interaction is stable.
  - Existing nodes and relationships can be queried and manipulated via the API.
- **Metrics**:
  - Prometheus integration is set up, and metrics are exposed via `/metrics`.

### **2. Documentation**
- **OpenAPI Spec**:
  - Fully generated and enhanced with detailed descriptions and examples.
  - Integrated with Postman for testing.
- **Test Framework**:
  - Postman collections are organized, with automated tests for key endpoints.
  - Dynamic test data (e.g., generated IDs) is supported.

### **3. Areas for Refinement**
- **Code Structure**:
  - Models are consolidated into `models.py` for simplicity.
  - Further modularization (e.g., services for complex Neo4j logic) may help scalability.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Basic error handling exists but could be standardized across all endpoints.
  - Specific errors for invalid relationships, non-existent nodes, etc., should be refined.
- **Validation**:
  - Input validation is basic. Complex validation (e.g., ensuring unique `id` across node types) can be implemented.

## **What to Work on Next**

### **A. Feature Enhancements**
1. **Task Assignment Workflow**:
   - Automate task assignment to agents based on their capabilities or availability.
   - Endpoint to query all tasks assigned to a specific agent.

2. **Agent Evolution**:
   - Allow agents to evolve capabilities or adjust their `base_prompt` dynamically based on completed tasks.
   - Introduce relationships that reflect growth or experience (e.g., `COMPLETED_TASKS`).

3. **Capability Management**:
   - Add CRUD endpoints for managing `Capability` nodes independently.
   - Allow linking capabilities to tasks as requirements.

---

### **B. Codebase Improvements**
1. **Modularize Neo4j Logic**:
   - Move complex Neo4j queries (e.g., relationship handling) into service or repository layers.
   - Simplify route files to focus on API logic.

2. **Standardize Responses**:
   - Ensure all endpoints return consistent response structures (e.g., status, data, and error fields).

3. **Error and Validation Handling**:
   - Implement custom exceptions for Neo4j and validation errors.
   - Add stricter input validation to ensure data consistency.

---

### **C. Testing and Observability**
1. **Expand Postman Tests**:
   - Test edge cases (e.g., invalid `id`, conflicting `capabilities_operation`).
   - Add validation for error responses (e.g., 404, 400).

2. **Prometheus Metrics**:
   - Add custom metrics for API usage (e.g., tasks created, relationships added).
   - Create dashboards in Grafana for visualizing metrics.

---

### **D. Future Roadmap**
1. **Agent Automation**:
   - Implement logic to allow agents to act on assigned tasks based on their `base_prompt`.
   - Use external AI models (e.g., GPT) to simulate agent decision-making.

2. **Dynamic Workflows**:
   - Enable dynamic workflows for task assignment and completion.
   - Introduce node states to track progress (e.g., `Task` nodes with `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`).

3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**:
   - Develop logic for agents to collaborate on tasks requiring multiple capabilities.

---

## **Proposed Next Steps**
1. Finalize a **task assignment workflow** to link tasks with agents and capabilities dynamically.
2. Implement **independent CRUD endpoints for `Capability`** nodes.
3. Standardize responses and error handling across the API.
