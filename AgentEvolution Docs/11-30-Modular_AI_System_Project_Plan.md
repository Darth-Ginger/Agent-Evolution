# Project Plan: Modular AI System with Evolving Agents

## Project Summary (Prompt for Transfer or Rebuilding)
**Prompt**: 
"I am designing a modular AI system to create a team of agents capable of evolving their capabilities over time, minimizing reliance on external API costs, and operating efficiently within a Dockerized environment. The system integrates Neo4j as a central vector database and knowledge graph for managing agent capabilities, tasks, relationships, and cached results. Agents interact dynamically with the orchestrator to execute tasks, refine outputs, and expand functionality by creating new API methods. The project emphasizes cost-effective API usage by leveraging caching, semantic search, and feedback loops. Please help refine or rebuild this system, focusing on scalable, low-cost, and efficient AI operations."

## Detailed Project Plan

### 1. Project Objectives
1. **Core Goal**: Create a team of AI agents capable of:
   - Collaborating on tasks.
   - Evolving their capabilities by dynamically creating and using API functions.
   - Minimizing OpenAI API costs.
2. **Key Features**:
   - **Dynamic API Creation**: Agents can register and call new API methods.
   - **Knowledge Management**: Use Neo4j as a vector database/knowledge graph for tasks, relationships, and caching.
   - **Efficiency**: Implement caching and semantic search to reduce redundant queries.
   - **Scalability**: Modular Dockerized architecture for deploying agents and services.

### 2. Architecture Overview

#### Core Components
1. **Orchestrator (Coordinator Agent)**:
   - Manages task delegation, agent communication, and caching.
   - Ensures agents don’t duplicate work and optimizes task flow.
2. **Specialized Agents**:
   - **Coding Agent**: Handles script/API generation and refinement.
   - **Research Agent**: Conducts web/API-based data retrieval.
   - **Planner Agent**: Breaks down complex tasks into subtasks.
   - Future agents can be added as needed.
3. **Neo4j as a Knowledge Graph**:
   - Stores agent capabilities, tasks, and relationships.
   - Embeddings for vector similarity search to enhance semantic context retrieval.
4. **Dynamic API Manager**:
   - Handles creation, validation, and execution of API methods by agents.
   - Tracks usage statistics to identify underperforming or redundant methods.
5. **Caching Layer**:
   - Reduces API costs by storing frequently accessed results and embeddings.
6. **Dockerized Infrastructure**:
   - Each component runs as an independent container for modularity and scalability.

### 3. Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Framework Setup
1. **Dockerized Environment**:
   - Create containers for the orchestrator, agents, and Neo4j.
   - Ensure inter-container communication (e.g., through Docker Compose).
2. **Basic Orchestrator**:
   - Implement task routing between user input and agents.
   - Add logging and monitoring for visibility into task flows.
3. **Neo4j Integration**:
   - Set up a Neo4j container and define a basic schema:
     - Nodes: Tasks, agents, capabilities, API methods.
     - Edges: Relationships between nodes (e.g., "can_execute", "depends_on").
   - Enable simple Cypher queries for retrieving nodes and relationships.

#### Phase 2: Specialized Agents
1. **Coding Agent**:
   - Implement basic code generation using OpenAI API.
   - Add functionality for testing and refining generated code.
2. **Research Agent**:
   - Integrate web scraping or API-based data retrieval.
   - Store retrieved data in Neo4j for future reference.
3. **Planner Agent**:
   - Build task decomposition logic to break user queries into manageable subtasks.
4. **Agent Communication**:
   - Use a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ) for task distribution and inter-agent messaging.

#### Phase 3: Dynamic API Manager
1. **API Creation**:
   - Enable agents to propose new API methods.
   - Validate methods to ensure they are secure and functional.
2. **API Execution**:
   - Register new methods in Neo4j.
   - Allow agents to call and reuse registered APIs.
3. **Monitoring and Validation**:
   - Track performance of API methods to optimize or deprecate low-use endpoints.

#### Phase 4: Optimization
1. **Caching System**:
   - Implement a Redis or Neo4j-based caching layer for frequently accessed results.
2. **Cost Minimization**:
   - Use embedding similarity search to retrieve cached responses instead of querying OpenAI.
   - Optimize prompt engineering to reduce token usage.
3. **Performance Tuning**:
   - Profile system components and streamline communication between agents.

#### Phase 5: Scaling and Evolution
1. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Allow agents to learn from task performance and refine their approaches.
   - Update Neo4j with new insights and relationships.
2. **Adding New Agents**:
   - Create domain-specific agents (e.g., design, analytics).
3. **Capability Refinement**:
   - Periodically review and update agent capabilities for efficiency.

### 4. Neo4j Schema Design

- **Node Types**:
  - `Agent`: Represents an agent (e.g., Coding Agent, Research Agent).
  - `Task`: Represents a user query or subtask.
  - `Capability`: Represents an agent’s skill or API method.
  - `API_Method`: Represents a dynamic API created by agents.

- **Relationships**:
  - `:CAN_EXECUTE`: Links an agent to a capability or API method.
  - `:DEPENDS_ON`: Links tasks to other tasks or capabilities.
  - `:USES`: Links tasks to API methods or cached results.

### 5. Technology Stack

#### Core Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python (for orchestrator and agent logic).
- **Database**: Neo4j (knowledge graph and vector database).
- **Docker**: Containerization of agents, orchestrator, and database.
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ or Redis (for inter-agent communication).

#### Libraries and Integrations
- **OpenAI API**: For agent-generated content and reasoning.
- **LangChain**: For managing prompt flows and embeddings.
- **Neo4j GDS**: For vector similarity search.
- **FastAPI**: For exposing a RESTful API to manage system interactions.

### 6. Example Use Case Workflow

1. **User Input**:
   - User submits a query to the orchestrator (e.g., "Build an API for calculating interest rates").
2. **Task Routing**:
   - The orchestrator assigns subtasks to:
     - Planner Agent: Breaks down the query.
     - Coding Agent: Generates the required API code.
3. **Neo4j Updates**:
   - New API methods are registered in Neo4j.
   - Relationships are created to link tasks, agents, and capabilities.
4. **Task Completion**:
   - Orchestrator consolidates results and delivers output to the user.
5. **Caching**:
   - Results and embeddings are cached for future reference.

### 7. Cost Management Strategies

1. **Prompt Optimization**:
   - Design minimal, efficient prompts to reduce token usage.
2. **Embedding Reuse**:
   - Cache embeddings for common queries to avoid redundant calls.
3. **Open-Source Models**:
   - Use local models for simple tasks to offload OpenAI API usage.

### 8. Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Infinite Loops**:
   - **Solution**: Set iteration limits and implement logging for traceability.
2. **API Validation**:
   - **Solution**: Automate validation and review of new methods.
3. **Data Overhead**:
   - **Solution**: Regularly prune unused nodes/edges from Neo4j.
